    This class implements a backtracking algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles, with an added

    loops over those options. This heuristic can significantly speed up the solving process
    for harder puzzles, although it may slightly slow down the process for easier puzzles due
    to the overhead of finding the cell with the fewest options at each step.

    _find_easiest_cell(board: SudokuBoard, row_idxs: List[int], col_idxs: List[int]) \

        Identify the cell on a Sudoku board with the fewest possible options, and return a tuple

        Next, it retrieves the coordinates of the empty cells on the board. If there are no empty
        cells, it returns True, indicating that the puzzle is solved.

        If there are empty cells, it selects the one with the fewest possible values and loops
        over those values. For each value, it places the value in the cell and makes a recursive
